In Britain and elsewhere the game is often called <span class="eb">American football</span> to show the difference between it and soccer. American football developed from the games of football and rugby. There is a lot of dangerous play, so <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/helmet" title="helmets definition"><span class="ndv">helmets</span></a></span> and thick <span class="eb"><span class="ndv" href="pad_subentryg_1:pad_topg_2" tofix="">pads</span></span> must be worn. Each game has <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/cheerleader" title="cheerleaders definition"><span class="ndv">cheerleaders</span></a></span> and bands of musicians that march on the field between the <span class="eb">halves</span> of the game. Whole families go to watch games, and there is almost no violence from supporters. Many games are shown live on US television. British television now also shows some games.

The field is 100 yards/91.5 metres long and 53 yards 1 foot/49 metres wide. It is sometimes called a <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/gridiron" title="gridiron definition"><span class="ndv">gridiron</span></a></span> because the lines across it that mark every 10 yards/9 metres make it look like the metal frame on which meat is cooked outdoors.

They can then add a <span class="eb">point after touchdown</span> (<span class="eb">PAT</span> or <span class="eb">extra point</span>) if they kick the ball through the goal posts.
