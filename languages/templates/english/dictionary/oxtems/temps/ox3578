If a main road passes through a town, that part of it usually has a name, often that of the place which the road goes to, for example, London Road.</span><span class="p">The main shopping street in a town is often called High Street, or sometimes Market Street. Many streets take their name from a local feature or building. The most common include Bridge Street, Castle Street, Church Street, Mill Street and Station Road. Some names indicate the trade that was carried on in that area in the past. Examples are Candlemaker's Row, Cornmarket, Petticoat Lane and Sheep Street. Many streets laid out in the 19th century were named after famous people or events. These include Albert Street, Cromwell Road, Shakespeare Street, Wellington Street, Trafalgar Road and Waterloo Street. When <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/housing-estate" title="housing estates definition"><span class="ndv">housing estates</span></a> are built, the names of the new roads in them are usually all on the same theme. Names of birds or animals are popular. Others are based on the old names for the fields that the houses were built on, for example Tenacres Road, The Slade and Meadow Walk. The name of a road is written on signs at each end of it.</span><span class="p">Some streets have become so closely identified with people of a particular profession that the street name itself is immediately associated with them. In London, <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/harley-street" title="Harley Street definition"><span class="ndv">Harley Street</span></a> has been associated with private doctors and <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/fleet-street" title="Fleet Street definition"><span class="ndv">Fleet Street</span></a> with newspapers.</span><span class="p">In the US main roads such as <span class="ndv" tofix="" href="interstate_subentryg_2:interstate_topg_3">interstates</span> and <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/highway" title="highways definition"><span class="ndv">highways</span></a> are known by numbers. Most towns and cities are laid out on a <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/grid" title="grid definition"><span class="ndv">grid</span></a></span> pattern and have long <span class="eb">streets</span> with <span class="eb"><a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/avenue" title="avenues definition"><span class="ndv">avenues</span></a></span> crossing them. Each has a number, for example, 7th Avenue, 42nd Street. The roads are often straight and have square <span class="eb">blocks</span> of buildings between them. This makes it easier to find an address and also helps people to judge distance. In <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/manhattan_2" title="Manhattan definition"><span class="ndv">Manhattan</span></a>, for example, <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/tiffany-s" title="Tiffany's definition"><span class="ndv">Tiffany's</span></a> is described as being at East 57th Street and Fifth Avenue, which means it is on the corner of those two streets. The distance between West 90th Street and West 60th Street is 30 blocks.</span><span class="p">As well as having numbers, many streets are named after people, places, local features, history and nature. In Manhattan there is Washington Street, Lexington Avenue, Liberty Street, Church Street and Cedar Street. Some streets are named after the town to which they lead. Streets called Post Road are named because the mail used be delivered along that route. The most important street is often called <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/main-street" title="Main Street definition"><span class="ndv">Main Street</span></a>.

Avenues usually cross streets, as in New York, but often the word is chosen as part of a name for no particular reason. <span class="ei">Avenue</span> and <span class="ei">boulevard</span> once indicated roads with trees along each side, but few have trees today.
