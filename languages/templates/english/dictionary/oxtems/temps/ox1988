This is mainly because of two strong traditions: the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/constitution" title="Constitution definition"><span class="ndv">Constitution</span></a> gives all Americans the right to own guns, and Americans have always hunted animals for food.

For these reasons, hunting is a sport for all classes and many people own <span class="eb">hunting <span class="ndv" href="rifle_subentryg_1:rifle_topg_2" tofix="">rifles</span></span>. Americans do not use the name <span class="ei">field sports</span>. Instead they say <span class="eb">outdoor sports</span> or, because that can include camping, walking and boating, simply <span class="eb">hunting and fishing</span>. <span class="eb">Bird hunting</span> is often used instead of <span class="ei">shooting</span>, because that can also mean shooting at targets made of wood.</span><span class="p">Many other Americans are against hunting, but animal rights groups have little power against organizations like the <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/the-national-rifle-association#the_national_rifle_association_topg_1" title="National Rifle Association definition"><span class="ndv">National Rifle Association</span></a>, which has more than 4 million members, and other groups that support hunting and fishing. <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/conservation" title="Conservation definition"><span class="ndv">Conservation</span></a> organizations sometimes also use their influence to protect the rights of people to hunt and fish.</span><span class="p">Rather than foxes, Americans generally hunt <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/deer" title="deer definition"><span class="ndv">deer</span></a>, <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/elk" title="elk definition"><span class="ndv">elk</span></a> <span class="gloss" htag="span" hclass="gloss">(= a type of deer)</span>, bear, <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/antelope" title="antelope definition"><span class="ndv">antelope</span></a>, <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/mountain-lion" title="mountain lion definition"><span class="ndv">mountain lion</span></a>, <a class="Ref" href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/raccoon" title="raccoon definition"><span class="ndv">raccoon</span></a> and wild birds.
